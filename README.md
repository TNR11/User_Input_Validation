<h1>User Input Validation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A program which asks the user for a score (as a double). The program then checks if the user provided score lies between the range 0-100, if it doesn't the program re-prompts for correct input. Once the input is within the correct range the program outputs the score as a grade based on coded rules/logic.
